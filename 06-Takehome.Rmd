shinyApp(ui, server)
```

This app takes a type of pokemon prompted from the user and 
a variable prompted by the user and gives out a histogram that
shows the count of the specific variable type.
The app also takes a bin number given by the user and
outputs that number of bins in the histogram.
The point of this app is to be able to see what the attack, defense, and speed variables
look like between the different types of pokemon.
